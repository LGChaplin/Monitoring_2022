# CODE FOR THE EXAM - Vaia Storm 26th-30th October 2018

# ANALYSIS OF NDVI ALBEDO FCOVER BEFORE AND AFTER VAIA STORM IN NORTHERN EAST ITALY (Dolomites)



# To read the Copernicus data I have to install a package two packages 
# I use "" to let R know that the data is external to the program 

# install.packages("ncdf4")
library(ncdf4)

# install.packages("raster")
library(raster)

# set the working directory
setwd("/Volumes/LaCie/Monitoring_2023")


### First analysis 

# Upload in R two NDVI images (with 300m resolution): one from August 2018 and the other from August 2019 
## I'm using "" because data are external to R and I need to import them
## The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator of the greenness of the biomes

August18 <- raster("c_gls_NDVI300_201808010000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.0.1.nc")
August19 <- raster("c_gls_NDVI300_201908010000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.0.1.nc")



## Crop images before plotting to avoid high time computer elaboration on heavy images 
## Crop on Italian Dolomites 

ext <- c(11,13,46,47)
August19_dolomites <- crop(August19, ext)
August18_dolomites <- crop(August18, ext)


#First plot

plot(August18_dolomites, main = "NDVI Dolomites August 2018")
plot(August19_dolomites, main = "NDVI Dolomites August 2019")


# Now I want to see the differences between the two time periods
# Check for differences in NDVI

Dif_NDVI_Aug <- August19_dolomites - August18_dolomites

# Creating a colour palette that highlights negative differences (biomass losses)
cl <- colorRampPalette(c('red','gold',"white","chartreuse1","darkgreen"))(100)

# Plot the differences
plot(Dif_NDVI_Aug, col= cl, main = "NDVI Difference Dolomites August 2018-2019")

## The dev.off() function turned out to not be necessary in my case 
## Didn't use it in the rest of the code
dev.off()

### Considerations:
### NDVI changes could be due to factors that aren't related to the Vaia storm
### Meaning the storm isn't the caus eof the differences in NDVI between the two time periods
### Other possible explanation: eg. August is a very dry month in Italy



### Second analysis 

### Let's now check for differences between the week before and after the storm (26-30 Oct. 2018)

October18 <- raster("c_gls_NDVI300_201810110000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.0.1.nc")
November18 <- raster("c_gls_NDVI300_201811010000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.0.1.nc")


# Crop images before plotting to avoid high time computer elaboration on heavy images 
# Area of the Italian Dolomites

ext <- c(11,13,46,47)         
October18_dol <- crop(October18, ext)
November18_dol <- crop(November18, ext)

# Check for differences in NDVI
Dif_NDVI_Nov_Oct <- November18_dol - October18_dol

# Creating a colour palette that highlights negative differences (biomass losses)
cl <- colorRampPalette(c('red','gold',"white","chartreuse1","darkgreen"))(100)

#Plot the differences
plot(Dif_NDVI_Nov_Oct, col= cl, main = "NDVI Difference Before and After Vaia Storm")


###----------------------------------------------------------------------


### Third analysis 

### Let's try using ALBEDO instead of NDVI which could also be affected by lower temperature or higher stress
### Albedo might pick up differences in type of land cover 
### Eg. more trees vs less trees = higher albedo vs lower albedo

Albedo_Oct18 <- raster("c_gls_ALDH_201810130000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.5.1.nc")
Albedo_Nov18 <- raster("c_gls_ALDH_201811030000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.5.1.nc")

# Crop images before plotting to avoid high time computer elaboration on heavy images 
# Crop on the Italian Dolomites

ext <- c(11,13,46,47)         

Albedo_Oct18_dolomites <- crop(Albedo_Oct18, ext)
Albedo_Nov18_dolomites <- crop(Albedo_Nov18, ext)

#Check for differences in NDVI
Dif_AL <- Albedo_Nov18_dolomites - Albedo_Oct18_dolomites

#Creating a colour palette that highlights negative differences (biomass losses)
Albedo_cl <- colorRampPalette(c('red','grey','black'))(100)

#Plot the differences
plot(Dif_AL, col= Albedo_cl, main = "Albedo Difference Before and After Vaia Storm")


### Considerations: 
### ALBEDO resolution too low (1 km), image very pixelated


###----------------------------------------------------------------------


### Fourth Analysis FCOVER between June 2018-2019

### NDVI and Albedo so far haven't proven satisfactory indicators enough
### Let's try using FCOVER 
### FCOVER 1 year distance: June 2018 and June 2019
### FCOVER is the fraction of ground covered by green vegetation 

FCover_June18 <- raster("c_gls_FCOVER300_201806100000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.0.1.nc")
FCover_June19 <- raster("c_gls_FCOVER300_201906100000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.0.1.nc")

# Crop images before plotting to avoid high time computer elaboration on heavy images (Choose one of the two options)
# Crop on the Italian Dolomites
ext <- c(11,13,46,47)   

FCover_June18_dolomites <- crop(FCover_June18, ext)
FCover_June19_dolomites <- crop(FCover_June19, ext)

#Check for differences in FCOVER
Dif_FC <- FCover_June19_dolomites - FCover_June18_dolomites 

#Creating a colour palette that highlights negative differences (biomass losses)
cl <- colorRampPalette(c('cornsilk1','blanchedalmond','darkgoldenrod3','palegreen1','green3','darkgreen'))(100)


#Plot the differences
plot(Dif_FC, col= cl, main = "FCOVER Difference June 18-19")


### Considerations: 
### Differences are noticeable


### Fifth analysis FCOVER between 2017-2018

# Let's look at the difference between Jun2017 and June 2018
FC_June17 <- raster("c_gls_FCOVER300_201706100000_GLOBE_PROBAV_V1.0.1.nc")

# Crop images before plotting to avoid high time computer elaboration on heavy images (Choose one of the two options)
# Crop on the Italian Dolomites
FC_June17_dolomites <- crop(FC_June17, ext)

Dif_FC_18_17 <- FCover_June18_dolomites  - FC_June17_dolomites 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Dif_FC, col= cl, main="FCOVER JUNE 18-19")
plot(Dif_FC_18_17, col= cl, main="FCOVER JUNE 17-18")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

### Considerations: 
### This last analysis and comparison gives the best results 
### In terms of visualization of the effects of the storm but also it's association to it
